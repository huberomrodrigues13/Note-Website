# Note-Website
## Overview
This GitHub repo showcases a beginner-friendly web-app I built using Flask and SQLite. 

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience and a better understanding of how web frameworks and relational databases work in Python. 
It's a small full-stack application that uses HTML and CSS for front-end visuals and styling, with Flaskâ€™s Jinja2 templating engine to connect the 
front end to the Python-powered backend.


## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key python files and folders:
  + _app_ folder = 
    + templates folder = Collection of all the front-end templates
      + base.html = The 'main' template that all others inherit from to have the same main styling choices
      + landpage.html = Template of what the user first sees when they go on the web-app
      + dashboard.html = Template Where the user can create and delete user-saved notes
      + login3.html = Template where the user logs in
      + signup.html = Template  where the user signs up 
    + models.py =  where database models are created for the user and his/her notes
    + routes.py = where all the url routes and their endpoint functions are written, including the views and authenticated routes
    + init.py   = where the function called by main is created, making a instance of flask app and a empty SQLite-database with blueprints initialized from elsewhere in the app folder
  + main.py = where the app gets created and run locally by
  + requirements.txt =  all the libraries from any packages installed 

## Setup
### To run this web app yourself, you will need to install the following(via pip):
  + flask
  + flask_sqlalchemy

#### To install the required Python packages, you can use the following commands:
    pip install flask
    pip install flask_sqlalchemy

    
#### Below is all the libraries from any packages installed and their versions when the project was created:
    blinker==1.9.0
