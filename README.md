## Overview
This GitHhub repo is a showcases a beginner-friendly web-app I built using Flask and SQLite. 

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience and a better understanding of how web frameworks and relational databases work in Python. 
It's a small full-stack application that uses HTML and CSS for front-end visuals and styling, with Flaskâ€™s Jinja templating engine to connect the 
front end to the Python-powered backend.
